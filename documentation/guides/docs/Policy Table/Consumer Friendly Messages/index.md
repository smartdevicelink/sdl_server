# Consumer Friendly Messages
There are certain scenarios when the SDL system needs to display a message to the user.  Some examples are when an error occurs or an application is unauthorized.  These messages can include spoken text and text displayed to a user in multiple languages.  All of this information is stored in the **consumer_friendly_messages** property.

## Messages
All messages are given a unique name (e.g. "AppUnauthorized" or "DataConsent") and stored as an object in the **consumer_friendly_messages** object's **messages** property.

### Language
Since each message should support multiple languages, each message object will contain a property named **languages**. Language properties are named by combining the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1" target="_blank">ISO 639-1</a> language code and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2" target="_blank">ISO 3166 alpha-2</a> country code.  For example, messages for **English** speaking citizens of the **United States** would be under the key **en-us**.

### Message Text
Inside each language object is the data to be read or spoken by the SDL system.  The data is organized in the following properties.

| Message Text Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| tts | String | Text that can be read aloud by the SDL system. |
| line1 | String | First line of text to be displayed on the head unit. |
| line2 | String | Second line of text to be displayed on the head unit. |
| text-body | String | Body of text to be displayed on the head unit. |
| label | String | TODO: What is this? |

## Version
The version property in the **consumer_friendly_messages** object defines the current version of all the messages.  It is used during a [poilcy table update](../../policy-table-update) to determine wether or not the consumer friendly messages need to be updated.  The version must be in the format `###.###.###`.

## Example
An example of how the Consumer Friendly Messages portion of a policy table might look.
